# CONFIG.INI
# This file contains notes throughout, which will serve as a guide if you would like to modify any given variables.
# This is how you should understand these notes.
#
# A note follows this basic structure:
#   variable [<data type> or list of possible values]: extra description of the variable
#
# Your variable should follow this format:
#   variable = value
#
# A value can be anything so long as it follows the specified <data type> or list of possible values.

# trigger_word [<any>]: field names beginning with this trigger word will apply color formatting to numbers
   trigger_word = score

# ranges [<list of numbers in ascending order>]: (a, b, c, d) will segment the scores into ranges [a, b); [b, c); [c, d); and d – where [a, b) includes a but excludes b
# scheme, scheme_alt [<list of hex codes without #>]
