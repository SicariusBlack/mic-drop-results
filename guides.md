## Getting your tokens

- Tokens are used to access Discord API to download profile pictures
- You can have more than one token in **token.txt** to avoid getting rate-limited
- You can follow these steps to get your own tokens<br>https://mee6.xyz/tutorials/how-to-generate-a-custom-bot-token
- You do not have to invite the bot to your server to get it working
- Because an application can only have one bot, you need to create multiple applications to create multiple bots, and therefore, multiple tokens.

## Customizing your templates

- Every slide in **template.pptm** is called a template
- You can assign a template to a contestant through the `template` column of **data.xlsx**
- More advanced customization at the last section (helpful for the designing process at the beginning of a season or for special rounds)
