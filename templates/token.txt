HOW TO GET YOUR TOKENS
-------
Follow the steps here to get your own bot token.

https://github.com/banz04/mic-drop-results/blob/main/docs/token.md

This token will be used to access Discord API to
  retrieve user avatars. You may insert more than
  one token to avoid rate limits from the API.


IS IT SAFE?
-------
Certainly. By inserting your bot token(s) here, you
  accept to authorize Mic Drop Results full access
  to the bot(s), without any access to your Discord
  account or any other bot that you currently own.

For extra safety, it is important not to invite the
  bot to any Discord server.

Do not post your tokens online either, as Discord
  keeps looking everywhere for your leaked tokens
  and disables them, thus making your token invalid
  and unusable for the program.


HOW THIS FILE WORKS
-------
The program will go through every line in this file.
  When it meets a line with more than 70 characters,
  the program will recognize such line as a token.

You can disable avatar_mode in settings.ini if you
  wish not to use this feature.
