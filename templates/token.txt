HOW TO GET YOUR TOKENS

Follow the steps from the link below to get your API
  token(s). It is important not to invite the bot to
  any server or post your bot token online.

This token will be used to access Discord API for
  user avatars. You can insert multiple tokens to
  avoid getting rate-limited.

Every application cannot have more than one bot; to
  get multiple tokens, you must therefore create
  multiple applications.


HOW THIS FILE WORKS
-------
The program will go through every line in this file,
  when it meets a line with more than 70 characters,
  it will recognize such line as a token.

Understanding the mechanism, you could now paste the
  tokens inside the pairs of quotation marks, remove
  or add similar lines if you must.

You may disable avatar_mode in settings.ini if you
  do not want to use this feature.
